I've decided to add on to my GUI, because there is a lot of extra space not being used.
I'm thinking that making a panel that displays the user's name and if it is their
turn or not on the right side of the GUI. Each player will have one, and if it is their
turn, then their rack will be shown as well as have their info panel bumped up to the top.
I've yet to decide if I would like to just make the racks invisible and then make them
visible when it's their turn, or just to paint the racks off of the view of the applet
and then swap the bounds when it's their turn. The info panels are a little easier, because
they are all shown at once, so I can just swap the bounds and it looks fine.
